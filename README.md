# BuJo

Welcome to BuJo, a single page bullet journal application built with JavaScript! View the video presentation [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iVFDpYdMHg&feature=youtu.be&ab_channel=RodrigoRojas).
<br/>

### With BuJo, a user can:
- Log in and log out with their name.
- Create and save new entries to journal.
- Update and save entries tou your liking.
- Delete entries from journal forever.
<br/>

# Motivation
To keep my schedule and my overall life organized, I like writing things down on a planner. My main motivation for making this app was to not only test the limits of my JavaScript skills, but also to create a responsive and clean app that could eventually be used as a digital planner.
<br/>

# Stretch Goals
The following stretch goals where set once I had minimal viable product.
- Task migration to different dates.
- Create new user functionality.
- Password functionality.
- Calendar accessability.
- Bullet icons for different tasks.
- Change theme button.
<br/>

# Running the App
In order to run BuJo first pull down [BuJo Backend](https://github.com/crrojas88/bujo-backend). Once you have the backend pulled, cd into it and run:
<br/>
```
rails s
```
Next, cd into [BuJo Frontend](https://github.com/crrojas88/bujo-frontend) and run the following command:
```
open index.html
```
You should now have access to the application!
## Logging In
